# Stanford Portfolio
This is the programming projects that I was able to save before my computer was wiped.
These have been completed over the last year and the content course is based off the Stanford
Class CS106B "Programming Abstractions." This doesn't include school curriculum coding.
Code Gets progressively harder throughout the course.
